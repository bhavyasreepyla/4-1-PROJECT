### **Introduction**

This repository implements a hybrid similarity model for collaborative filtering to improve recommendations in sparse data environments. By leveraging various models for item similarity and a novel approach for user similarity, the model enhances prediction accuracy for MovieLens-100k dataset.

### **Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a robust collaborative filtering model that addresses the challenges of sparse data in recommendation systems. By combining Wasserstein distance-based item similarity and a unique user similarity calculation, the model aims to improve recommendation quality and accuracy
