### **Introduction**
This repository implements a hybrid similarity model for collaborative filtering to improve recommendations in sparse data environments. By leveraging various models for item similarity and a novel approach for user similarity, the model enhances prediction accuracy for MovieLens-100k dataset.

---

### **Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a robust collaborative filtering model that addresses the challenges of sparse data in recommendation systems. By combining Wasserstein distance-based item similarity and a unique user similarity calculation, the model aims to improve recommendation quality and accuracy

### **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Preparation**: Combine training and testing data from multiple folds into single comprehensive datasets.  
2. **Similarity Computation**: Calculate similarity models between users.  
3. **Visualization**: Generate heatmaps to illustrate the computed similarity matrix.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Analyze the workflow's effectiveness in handling sparse data without generating actual recommendations.
